This is a template for CoCo Assignments 

coco.sty is a style formatting for all assignments, you shouldn’t have to edit it.

In hw*-sol.tex you can edit the list of assigned problems on page 1 and the date to submit.

In hw*-body.tex you can edit what the specific questions are (copy out of Sipser) and answer them under \answer{}. 

Remember to change the Names and KUnetID’s to those of your group under question 0. 

ShareLatex - On ShareLatex you’ll have to add hw*-sol.tex under “Main document” in the menu in order to compile.
